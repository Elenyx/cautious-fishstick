# DynastyScreen ‚Äî UX Design Summary

Goal: Give players a fast, legible overview of their bloodline and instant access to heir details and actions.

## Layout:

- Header Bar: Dynasty name, realm crest, prestige, succession law pill (tap ‚Üí law info).
- Tree Canvas: Pan/zoomable graph of generations (top ‚Üí old; bottom ‚Üí young).
- Toolbar: Focus (You / Heir / Founder), Filter (Alive / All), Zoom +/-.
- Heir Sheet (Modal): Stats (health, intrigue, stewardship‚Ä¶), titles & claims, traits, relationships, quick actions (Arrange Marriage, Educate, Disinherit*, Grant Title*, Plot*).
* gated by laws/resources.

Performance: Use react-native-svg for nodes/edges, and simple pan/zoom transforms on the <Svg> layer. Virtualization is usually not necessary for ‚â§ 200 nodes.

# üîß Implementation Tips

Traits: keep a small set at first (Brave, Just, Deceitful, Genius) each giving ¬± to Opinion, War, Intrigue.
Stats: Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue, Learning (CK-like), but you can compress into 3 if you prefer.

## Performance:

- Keep tree layout O(N) with a single pass; avoid re-layout on every small change.
- For very big families, paginate by generation, or collapse non‚Äëdirect branches.

Content Packs: separate events by era/culture‚Äîe.g., events_medieval.json, events_modern.json‚Äîand pick based on Sandbox rules.
